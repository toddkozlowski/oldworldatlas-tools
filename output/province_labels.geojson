Steaming lava from beneath the earth's crust covers the ash wastes with a blanket of bubbling magma."

It lies at the far north-eastern corner of the Empire. Though Ostermark existed at the time the Empire was founded by Sigmar, the League of Ostermark itself was formed out of the chaos of the late 19th century IC during the Age of Three Emperors, when its former capital of Mordheim was struck by a comet of tremendous size. The resulting destruction of the province's central government and the death of its ruling family led the remaining towns and villages of the lands of Ostermark to band together and form a new, oligarchic government which would later become known as the League of Ostermark."

          "description": "Magritta, formally the Kingdom of Magritta, is the largest and one of the most important cities in Estalia. Built by natural deep-water harbours within the sheltered Bay of Quietude, its reputation as a friendly port with ready markets for all manner of cargoes draws traders from many ports across the world of Mallus. Its quays are usually crowded, and, among the assortment of Old Worlder merchantmen, one can occasionally catch a glimpse of a strangely rigged craft from Araby or even further afield."
