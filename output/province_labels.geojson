Others are frost-caged mischievous naiads or spiteful kelpies, imprisoned by Elven magics in punishment for past misdeeds or to prevent future ones. These statues flow and reform when the eye does not rest upon them, the creatures inside ever seeking to escape."

Shaped by the perpetual gloom, the Wood Elves and nature spirits of the Night Glens are spiteful even by the standards of Athel Loren. They practise magics and customs that are forbidden in other realms, and worship gods most other Wood Elves shun."

Inevitably, the rippling heat from Vaul's Anvil draws forest spirits from the nearby groves, who watch the striking of hammer upon anvil with childlike fascination. Such creatures love the flame for the warmth and life it gives, but are also wary of it for the harm it can wreak if left untended."

The Wood Elves of Athel Loren's other realms consider the Ashenhall to be a drab and sombre place. As proof, they point to the lugubrious character of its inhabitants and the cinereal colourings of their raiment. There is no joyful song in Ashenhall, they say, just the dirges of Elves who live ever under the shadow of death."

Here too can be found the Feast Halls of the Wardance — the closest thing that the nomadic Wardancers of Athel Loren have to a home. As a result, the glades of Fyr Darric always resound to the sound of laughter, though much of it is mean-spirited. Every deception requires a victim, and the consequences can range from wounded pride to a slow death."

It lies at the far north-eastern corner of the Empire. Though Ostermark existed at the time the Empire was founded by Sigmar, the League of Ostermark itself was formed out of the chaos of the late 19th century IC during the Age of Three Emperors, when its former capital of Mordheim was struck by a comet of tremendous size. The resulting destruction of the province's central government and the death of its ruling family led the remaining towns and villages of the lands of Ostermark to band together and form a new, oligarchic government which would later become known as the League of Ostermark."
